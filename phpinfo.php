你们脚本小子整天扫网站有意思吗？扫之前不做个指纹识别一下？AWVS 扫静态网站是不是有病，能扫出个鬼啊，静态网站连后台都没有，真不知道扫啥玩意儿
另外网站有日志的知道吗，AWVS 特征这么明显，你服务器高匿名了吗？非法扫描入侵违法的知道吗？真要扫搞个多层高匿服务器再来吧，虽然最后还是扫不出啥玩意。


您已经发现我们的网站,这说明您掌握了一定的技能。
但请记住,仅靠扫描器是不够的。
若想成为优秀的安全研究人员,还需要学习:

- Web应用安全
- 后端代码安全
- 网络协议安全
- 系统漏洞分析
- ...

我建议您关注这些主题,再回来与我们交流。
互利共赢,共建一个更安全的网络。


You have discovered our website, which means you have a certain skill.
But remember, scanners alone are not enough.
If you want to become an excellent security researcher, you also need to learn:


- Web application security
- Backend code security
- Internet protocol security
- System vulnerability analysis
-...


I encourage you to follow these topics and come back to chat with us.
Mutual benefit and win-win, to build a more secure network.


Do you script kiddies have fun scanning websites all day? Don't do a fingerprint recognition before scanning? AWVS scan static website is not sick, can scan a ghost, static website does not even have a background, I really don't know what to scan
In addition, do you know that the website has logs? The AWVS feature is so obvious. Is your server highly anonymous? Do you know that illegal scanning is illegal? I really want to sweep up a multi-layer high-secret server and come back, although I still can't find anything in the end.

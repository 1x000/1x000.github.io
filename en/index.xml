&lt;p>The bat batch processing script is as follows&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>&lt;span class="cl">@echo off

&lt;li>
&lt;p>Garbled characters are all related to character encoding. .&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Computers can only process numbers. If text is encountered, it must be converted to a number before processing. This is where character encodings (character sets) come in. . If you use a certain character encoding for encoding, you must use the same character encoding for decoding. If different character encodings are used, garbled characters will appear. .&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;h3 id="convert-the-encoding-of-script-files">Convert the encoding of script files&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>By default, in the bat script file, if the Chinese is not ANSI encoding, garbled characters will appear. Therefore, you can use the Notepad that comes with the Windows operating system platform to open the script file, click the menu [File] - [Save As], and select ANSI encoding to save.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After converting the encoding and running it again, the Chinese garbled problem was solved.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Superconductivity is the phenomenon of zero electrical resistance and expulsion of magnetic fields in certain materials when they are cooled below a critical temperature. Superconductors have many applications, such as magnetic resonance imaging, quantum computing, and high-speed trains. However, most superconductors require extremely low temperatures (below -200 °C) and high pressures to operate, which limits their practical use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this article, we introduce LK-99, a novel material that claims to be a superconductor at room temperature and ambient pressure. LK-99 is a mix of powdered compounds of lead, oxygen, sulphur and phosphorus. When it is heated at very high temperatures, it forms a dark grey solid. According to the new research, the material exhibits some of the common characteristics of superconductors, such as zero resistivity, critical current, and a critical magnetic field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>LK-99 was first discovered and manufactured by a team of researchers including Sukbae Lee and Ji-Hoon Kim from Korea University. The team claims that LK-99 functions as a superconductor at ambient pressure and below 400 K (127 °C; 260 °F). As of 3 August 2023, the synthesis of LK-99 and observation of its superconductivity at any temperature have not been peer-reviewed or independently replicated. The announcement was widely shared and the reaction by the scientific world was mainly skeptical due to the extraordinary nature of the claims, the repeated failure of previous claims of room-temperature superconductors, and errors and inconsistencies in the pre-published papers. Independent teams are attempting to replicate the South Korean team&amp;rsquo;s work, with results expected in August 2023 owing to the straightforward method of producing the material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The claim of LK-99 has also sparked a race among DIY enthusiasts and amateur scientists to reproduce the experiment at home or in their labs. Some of them have posted videos on Bilibili, a Chinese video-sharing platform, showing their attempts to synthesize LK-99 and test its magnetic properties. One of the most popular videos was posted by an account named &amp;ldquo;Guan Shan Kou Male Technician&amp;rdquo;, who claimed to have successfully synthesized LK-99 crystals that can levitate over a magnet with a larger angle than the original paper. However, he also said that he still needs to verify the electrical resistance to confirm the superconductivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The claim of LK-99 has also received some support from theoretical calculations. A team from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the US published a paper on arXiv, claiming that they have found the theoretical basis for the superconductivity of copper-doped lead phosphate apatite, which is the structure of LK-99. They used computer models to describe the characteristics that a room-temperature superconductor should have, and found that LK-99 matches those criteria.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If confirmed, LK-99 would be a breakthrough in the field of superconductivity and could have a huge impact on many industries, such as electronics, energy, and transportation. However, until then, LK-99 remains a controversial and unverified claim that needs further investigation and validation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>blockdrop server FDP config</title><link>https://blog.xpdbk.com/en/post/blockdrop-bp/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://blog.xpdbk.com/en/post/blockdrop-bp/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.xpdbk.com/en/post/blockdrop-bp/ewe.webp" alt="Featured image of post blockdrop server FDP config" />&lt;h2 id="blockdrop-bypass">Blockdrop bypass&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>The name of the site is xpdbk. When I registered the domain name, I thought about a name that was easy to pronounce for a long time, and I came up with such a thing. In fact, the meaning of this name is &lt;strong>Little Pang’s Blog&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Why build this blog?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This blog is built to share some more interesting and fun things, and at the same time record some tossing processes. The core reason is because I want to localize the articles I wrote and don&amp;rsquo;t want to be deleted&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How to start a blog?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>you can learn from the basics&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Why static framework - Hugo?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In fact, I used hexo and vuepress in the early days, but in the end they gave up because they were not compatible with Windows7. Later, I discovered hugo, which was quite easy to use. It avoided the bloat of npm and the excessive dependence on the network and system, which made me feel instantly It&amp;rsquo;s very cool, and the migration of the theme is more convenient. I have been using it until now, and there is a &lt;code>hugo-theme-stack&lt;/code> on hugo that I am quite satisfied with. Static blogs are easier to manage and operate. A novice like me is not suitable for playing dynamic blogs at present, and dynamic blogs don’t have the spare time to deal with attacks and performance, so I have to choose static blogs&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>According to the law of mainland China, modifying the game is a crime of destroying the computer system&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Forge loader itself is a plug-in. Forge dynamically modifies the bytecode of minecraft to achieve more gameplay and functions. This behavior is also allowed by Minecraft.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Minecraft (that is, the international version and offline version) is a Java game produced by Mojang and was later acquired by Microsoft. However, due to the official EULA agreement of Minecraft, it is not allowed to modify the game body jar and distribute the original file to others. But it allows players to indirectly use mod loaders (Forge loaders, etc.) to dynamically modify the Java bytecode of the game, thus deriving mods that can expand gameplay and have a huge mod community&lt;/p>
&lt;h5 id="netease-minecraft">Netease Minecraft&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Minecraft (NetEase Proxy Version) is a game authorized by Microsoft to allow NetEase to act as an agent in mainland China. The official does not allow players to use mods to load into the game without permission. The game client cannot be offline and must be connected to the Internet to play. The NetEase agreement has written Players cannot modify the game without permission.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The essence of Mod is that a group of bigwigs reverse-engineered the Minecraft client to create mod loaders such as Forge to implement indirect dynamic modifications to the minecraft body, ranging from small memory repairs to various large mods that your computer cannot run.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is a plug-in based on Minecraft Mod. It uses loaders such as Forge to modify key bytecodes of the game (motion nodes, etc.) to achieve functions such as aimbot (self-aiming) or Speed (speed). Mojang will not officially block it because it is legal and open source on github&lt;/p>
